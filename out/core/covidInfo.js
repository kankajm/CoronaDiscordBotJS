Most people with coronavirus have at least 1 of these symptoms. If you have any of the main symptoms of coronavirus: Get a test to check if you have coronavirus as soon as possible. You and anyone you live with should stay at home and not have visitors until you get your test result – only leave your home to have a test. Anyone in your support bubble should also stay at home if you have been in close contact with them since your symptoms started or during the 48 hours before they started.";
